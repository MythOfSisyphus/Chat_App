**Now the code structure**

*App.js* is the main file which contains the server and *socket.io* part

in *public* folder I've 3 files *chat.html*, *chat.js* & "index.html*

when we start the server *index.html* is served, then after filling form in 

that file we redirect to *chat.html* which is for rooms and chatting and 

*chat.js* is *JavaScript* file for *Chat.html* 

And I used **TailwindsCSS**'s CDN to style CSS in html files.
